# tailwind-starter
A starter, bare-bones, WordPress theme set up for a simple tailwind development. Utilizes Laravel Mix and is a treat to work with.


## Browser-Sync
First define your browsersync settings in webpack.mix.js. There is some commented out code where you can set things like proxy server and whatnot.

Use `npm run watch` to start the build and it will scan your .php files and build you a slim css file. 

Happy Theming.
